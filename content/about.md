Hi all,

My name is Kuba.
I'm an IT Developer based in Warsaw, Poland.
This will be a blog about technology, something
like `learning notes`. I still need to learn a lot
of tools, technics, and methodologies. These posts
will become learning material for myself, I publish
it for easy access in the future. If anyone finds here
some useful stuff that will be awesome.
If not - what will be my fault. Then just ping me I'll fix it :)
