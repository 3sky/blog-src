Hi all,

My name is Kuba. I'm IT Developer based in Warsaw, Poland. This will be a blog about technology, something like `learning notes`. I still need to learn a lot of tools, technics and methodologies. This posts will become learning material for myself, I publish it for easy access in future. If anyone find here some useful stuff that will be awesome. If not - what will be my fault. Then just ping me I'll fix it :)
