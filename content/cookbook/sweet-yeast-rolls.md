# Welcome

My wife was at the dentist, and she couldn't eat hard stuff.
As the best husband ever I decided to bake soft rolls.

## Steps

- Make Tangzhong gruel

  - add flour, milk, and water into a pan
  - heat the pan with constantly stirring
  - you want to get the gruel with a temperature around `65` Celsius degrees

- Mix dough ingredients with gruel

  - take a bowl
  - add all stuff without butter
  - mix it until you get smooth dought
  - when adding butter and mix it again
  - dought should be `smooth, elastic and a bit sticky`

- Give a dought time to rest

  - cover bowl
  - leave it for `1-2h`

- Make small 12 balls

  - split dought into `12` balls
  - use a bit of flour for splitting
  - cover it and leave for `15` min

- Make rolls

  - take one ball and put in on a table with some flour
  - use a rolling pin to make it flatter
  - fold it in half
  - use rolling pin again
  - roll in into barrel
  - leave it for `15 min`

- put rolls into a plate

- use egg and sugar

  - mix the egg and cover the top part of rolls
  - add sugar with cinnamon on mixed egg layer
