# Welcome

Still quarantine. I should be Prima April's joke, but I started
thinking about the idea. After few days I searched
again for some recipe. I know that there are Notes app
like `Keep` for storing links, browsers bookmarks, etc.
But still, a lot of advertising, too many useless information.
The cooking blog should be clean with few pictures, with a straight
plan and ingredients list. So let's start.

## Ingredients

- 100g of sourdough
- 200g of wheat flour
- 100ml of warm milk (**NOT HOT**)
- teaspoon of salt

## Steps

- [ ] Mix all ingredients in bowl

  - [ ] raw dough should be bit sticky
  - [ ] do not add to many flour

- [ ] Cover the bowl with a cloth and put into the oven

  - [ ] 30 Celsius degrees
  - [ ] at least 2 hour
  - [ ] dough should grow around 70%

- [ ] Put it out and make buns

  - [ ] throw flour on table
  - [ ] make at least 4 buns
  - [ ] small, flat shapes

- [ ] Put it again into the oven

  - [ ] wait for extra grow
  - [ ] around 30minuts

- [ ] Slit top part of row buns

  - [ ] make `X` or `|` with a knife
  - [ ] smear with water
  - [ ] sprinkle with sesame seeds or other seeds

- [ ] Change temperature to 180 Celsius degrees

   - [ ] After warm the oven to correct temperate wait 20minuts

1. Done!
